# Two-Sample T-Test Analysis

## Overview

This Python script performs a two-sample t-test to compare the means of two independent groups. It calculates statistical measures, conducts the t-test, and visualizes the results using plots.

## Features

- **User Input**: Prompts the user to input data for two groups and their names.
- **Statistical Analysis**: Computes means, standard deviations, and performs a two-sample t-test.
- **Visualization**: Creates a plot with:
  - Normal distribution curves for each group.
  - Shaded areas representing probability density.
  - Mean lines and confidence intervals.
  - Inference text summarizing the t-test results.

## Requirements

To run this script, you need to have the following Python libraries installed:

- `numpy`
- `matplotlib`
- `scipy`

You can install the required libraries using pip:

```sh
pip install numpy matplotlib scipy
